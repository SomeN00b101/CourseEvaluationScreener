## Issues

### Course Name Subsets

Some courses have names that are subsets of each other (ex. "Operating Systems" and "Advanced Operating Systems"), so downloading for Operating Systems also downloads Advanced Operating Systems.

### Schoastic Search

The search is resulting in a variable number of pdfs downloaded each time. Unsure of the root cause. This may be a sign to switch to searching with class codes.

Update: Search by course number doesn't work directly

## Next Steps

## New Ideas

### Search by Course

As classes have had variable course numbers and course names, we should instead only group by course number, as that is likely the Registrar's way of differentiating classes, not course name
